This program demonstrates the basic functionality of the Karel robot in a grid-based world. It uses the Karel2 library to interact with a pre-designed map and perform actions such as moving, picking up, and placing beepers. The program initializes a robot in a custom world and provides it with a sequence of commands to navigate the environment.

Key Features:
Custom World Setup:

The program loads a pre-designed map (first.map) and configures the grid size to 8x8 for a controlled environment.
Robot Actions:

The robot, karel, follows a series of commands:
Moves through the grid.
Picks up a beeper from one location.
Places the beeper in a new location.
Executes turns and continues navigation.
Interactive Animation:

The setSpeed method ensures the robot's movements are animated smoothly for visualization.
Purpose:

The program is designed to introduce basic programming concepts such as sequential execution, method calls, and robot behavior in a simulated environment.
